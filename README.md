# [SMPL CMS](https://github.com/gowondesigns/smpl)

SMPL is a single file, template independent, open-source, standards-compliant, extensible content management system for the web, created and maintained by Gowon Patterson for [Gowon Designs](http://gowondesigns.com).

To get started, checkout [https://github.com/gowondesigns/smpl](https://github.com/gowondesigns/smpl)!



## Quick Start

Two quick start options are available:

* [Download the latest release](https://github.com/gowondesigns/smpl/zipball/master).
* Clone the repo: `git clone git://https://github.com/gowondesigns/smpl.git`.



## Versioning

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, Optimo will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch
